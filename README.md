# IPL-Data-Analysis
This repository contains a data analysis project focused on IPL (Indian Premier League) data. The analysis is performed using a Jupyter Notebook and explores various aspects of player performance and match statistics.
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook where I practiced data analysis skills using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

- **Objective**: Explore, clean, and analyze a dataset to extract meaningful insights.
- **Skills Practiced**:
  - Data Cleaning
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Data Visualization
  - Statistical Analysis
 
## ðŸ“š Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Files

* `IPL-Data-Analysis.ipynb`:  The main Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis code.
* `README.md`:  This file, providing an overview of the project.
* `data/ball_by_ball_ipl.csv`: (Optional - if you include the data) The dataset used for the analysis.

## Data Source

The data used in this project is obtained from the Kaggle dataset: [jamiewelsh2/ball-by-ball-ipl](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jamiewelsh2/ball-by-ball-ipl)


## Setup and Installation

1.  ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/aniketryback/IPL-Data-Analysis.git](https://github.com/aniketryback/IPL-Data-Analysis.git)
    ```
2.  (Optional) If you're running the notebook locally, make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn kagglehub
    ```

## Usage

* Open and run the `IPL-Data-Analysis.ipynb` notebook to reproduce the analysis.

## Key Findings (You'll update this as you progress)

* (Example)  In 2022, JC Buttler scored the highest runs in the first innings.
* (Add more findings as you complete your analysis)

## Future Work

* Visualize key player statistics.
* Analyze win/loss patterns across different venues.
* Develop a predictive model for match outcomes.
